    Description for a gain (voltage divider or amplifier) at an ADC input

compatible: "adc-gain"

properties:
    io-channels:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Channels available with this divider configuration.

    numerator:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Resistance of the lower leg of the voltage divider

    denominator:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Resistance of the full path through the voltage divider.

    raw-offset:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Offset to be substracted from ADC raw reading before applying the gain

    enable-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Enable the voltage divider input or amplifier.

        If present the corresponding GPIO must be set to an active level
        to enable the divider input.
